# TUNE Calibration file format - v. 5.13 and later
#
# ï»¿Calibration data is imported into TUNE as a text file
# with [frequency,sensitivity] pairs, one for each row.
# Minimum 3 frequency points must be listed, at least
# partially covering the frequency range of interest.
# Frequency points may be arbitrary, provided that
# they appear in ascending order.
# Values for missing frequencies are linearly interpolated 
# and those for frequencies outside listed range are
# extrapolated keeping first or last value as a constant.
# Units are Hz for frequencies and dB re 1 V/microPa for 
# sensitivities (M).
# Alternatively, scale factors (SF) in Pa may be used: the
# program recognizes either representation from the sign
# of first value (negative for M, positive for SF).
# Any row beginning with non-numeric character is ignored,
# such as these header lines starting with '#'.
# Blank lines are also ignored.
# Preferred field separator between the two columns is tab.
# Other separators such as space or comma might be used as well,
# but not a combination of them otherwise rows with different
# separator than first data row will be skipped.
# Decimal separator must be point, using comma is unsupported.
#
# Two examples are given below of accepted calibration data format.
# First one is with M in dB, second one is with SF in pascal.
