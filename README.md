This repository is for storing calibration files to be used with TUNE software (https://github.com/sbuogo/TUNE) for processing underwater sound in agreement with applicable standards, best practices and guidelines ([ISO](https://www.iso.org/standard/62406.html), [NPL Guide](https://www.npl.co.uk/gpgs/underwater-noise-measurement), 
[TG Noise](https://mcc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/201605183553.pdf)), as well as with requirements set in EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive 
([MSFD](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/environment/oceans-and-seas/eu-marine-strategy-framework-directive_en)).

Calibration file names refer to instrumentation and date.
